You'll have to DL the RDIO.crx.zip file if you want to install into Chrome and test it out. Unzip an the drag it into a new Chrome tab and it'll ask for your permission to install. Now whenever you visit RDIO.com and play music in your account you can have a custom screensaver for your playlist. Shift-8 to activate.

I created this because @ Quickleft (http://quickleft.com), we listen to RDIO all day long and people will occassionally ask me what's playing.  Its been asked much less often since this has gone into effect.

========================================================

Instructions: To enable - hit shift-8 and it'll slide down a simple black background and show you white animated text with Song Title/Album/Artist.

Move the mouse to bring the player back up.

Shift-8 or Click on the screen to make the screensaver go away.
========================================================

Future Changes: Make the screen slide down as soon as the user is idle for a couple of minutes. Other suggestions?
